Use CoffeeScript as a zen generator in javascript files.

## What ?

**CoffeeZen**, as his name says, is a kind of *zencoding/emmet* for javascript, using CoffeeScript.

Some times, you need to edit plain `javascript` files, and you will be happy to use coffeescript, but you can't, for some reasons.

**CoffeeZen** allows you to type CoffeeScript, trigger a command and compile it, in place, as plain javascript.

## Usage

Inside a `javascript file`, select a text, then trigger the command `coffeezen` (in the command panel), or use the keyboard shortcut `TODO`.
